This web app will target people who want to get up and get productive and learn different skills to do projects themselves.  There will be a rating system on which one is better. This will lead to the tutorials that are accurate and precise to be on top. 

How To aims to provide a central location for anyone looking to find reliable, highly-rated projects reviewed and tested by users like them. Users can find and become apart of a community that has similar passions to their own, where they can read, follow, and post about projects they are interested in.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## Cloudinary

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

 - REACT_APP_BE_URL=http://localhost:5000
 - REACT_APP_FE_ROOT=http://localhost:3000


üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products
